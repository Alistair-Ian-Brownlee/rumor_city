This is an RP HUD system consisting of health, modifiers and a dice roll. The system also contains an admin HUD.

- Players can select their race from a choice of "Human", "Bio-Mech","Android","Replicant","Were" or"Neo-Vampire".
- Players have 6 health points.
- Players can have up to 9 modifier points to spend. Some modifiers are auto-assigned points according to their race.
- Players can plug their modifier points into a choice of "Attack", "Evade", "Stealth", "Detect" & "Strength".
- Once a player has finalized their character and modifiers points they can not reset the HUD themselves but instead have to contact an admin to reset the HUD via the admin HUD.
- Players can select a fellow player and make an Attack, or a Detect or a Strength roll against them. The roll is up to 20.

- When a player makes a roll against an opponent, the opponent automatically rolls. The highest roll wins the round.
    -  If a player Attacks, their roll is modified according to how many points they added to the Attack skill while their opponent’s Evade roll is modified according to how many points they added to their Evade skill. If the Attackers roll is higher than the opponent's Evade roll, the opponent loses a health point.
    -  If a player Detects an opponent, their roll is modified according to how many points they added to the Detect skill while their opponent’s Stealth roll is modified according to how many points they added to their Stealth skill. If the Detectors roll is higher than the opponent's Stealth roll, the opponent is detected.
    -  Both player's strength roll is modified according to how many points they added to the Strength skill. Whosever Strength roll is higher is the stronger player.

- Health points replenish over time and can also be added or taken away from the admin HUD.
- Players are also awarded re-rolls from a lottery tied to an SQL database or from an admin HUD. Players can choose to spend a re-roll point any time their roll is lower than their opponent's roll to get a better roll.  
- Players can store up to 3 re-rolls
- Players can page an admin from their HUD to oversee/mediate a roleplay and modify their RP HUDs.
- Player stats are also stored in the SQL database and linkset data for persistent memory across script resets, version changes, HUD updates, etc.
